      <div id="generalContent" class="content">The <b>Fetal-Neonatal Neuroimaging and Developmental Science Center (FNNDSC) at Boston Children's Hospital</b> brings together a multidisciplinary team of researchers from the fields of medicine, engineering, computer science, and neuroscience to create the infrastructure and provide the expertise needed to support and foster cutting edge clinical and translational science.</div>
      <div id="researchContent" class="content">The Center's research combines three key imaging modalities: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) across multiple subspecialties. The combined modalities provide unique data allowing the Center's researchers to study the brain development of fetal and newborn subjects in new and fascinating ways.</div>
      <div id="softwareContent" class="content">The FNNDSC also designs and develops software for processing large data sets in an effective and clinically meaningful way. The Center is committed not only to being an active player at the cutting edge of MRI research, but importantly also to bring the products of its research as quickly as possible to the broader clinical community.The FNNDSC is also committed to High Performance Computation (HPC) initiatives, and is leading a collaborative effort to design and deploy a compute cluster at Boston Children's Hospital.</div>
